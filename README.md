# Options
You may want to `define` the following options upon compilation (with adding them with `-D` key into `DEFINE_FLAGS` variable of `compile` script):
  * `DEBUG` -- classic for showing and printing some info useful for debugging;
  * `FAST_DDA` -- introducing DDA algorithm that does not use square roots at all (set by default);
  * `NO_RENDER_TEX` - render the world without textures;
